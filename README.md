Local Storage
-----------

Presentation code sample projects and Keynote deck for Local Storage presentation from November 20, 2014.

Many types of mobile applications benefit from being able to storage data local to the data.

Reaching out across the network is slow compared to referencing data on the device.

There are also times when we need to hold data for local use later on, or for transmission to the network.


Two projects will be presented:

ios : An iOS project demonstrating how to use CoreData

android : An Android project demonstrating how to use SQLite
